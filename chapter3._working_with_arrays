Excercises
1. Write a code snippet that sets a to an array of n random integers between 0 (inclusive) and n
(exclusive). 

val n = 5
val arr = (for (i <- 0 until n)
	yield scala.util.Random.nextInt(n))
	.toArray[Int]

2. Write a loop that swaps adjacent elements of an array of integers. For example, Array(1,
2, 3, 4, 5) becomes Array(2, 1, 4, 3, 5).
